# resilienthawaii.org charts

Just a bunch of charts.

Here's the plan:

- Ryan is going to work on JS widget charts
- Suchandra is going to work on R charts

At some point, we will circle back with one another and just embed them into a
single site.

## Browsersync

Since I always forget this command, adding it here:

browser-sync start --server "site" --files "site/*.html" --index "index.html"
